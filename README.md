# EpicCrunch-Burger
My project is called EpicCrunch Burger. I used React.js, React Routers Dom, React Formik and Yup in my project. I added Navbar and Footer components to my App.js page to be valid on every page I click. I imported Routes and Routes. There is an "Order Now" button on the homepage. When I press the button, it automatically sends it to the menu in the navbar. In my Data.js page, I wrote all the data in the menu section as objects one by one. There are name, image, content and price. In the About Us section, there are interior and exterior pictures of the place I dreamed of and information about the place. In the contact section, I divided the page into two with flex:50%. On the left side there is an image from the inside of the venue and on the right side there is a form. In this way, we can contact the venue. Thanks to the form, the send button will not work without typing the name, surname, e-mail and message parts.
